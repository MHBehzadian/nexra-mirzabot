# nexra-mirzabot

A fork of [mahdiMGF2/botmirzapanel](https://github.com/mahdiMGF2/botmirzapanel)
(GPLv3) with these additions baked in:

- **Nexra Panel integration** as a new panel type — user creation/edit/delete
  go through Nexra (so admin traffic quotas are enforced), while reads
  (status, subscription link, config links) go straight to the real Marzban
  instance for full fidelity.
- Adding/removing/editing a panel or its connection details is gated behind
  a secret code (`NEXRA_SECRET_CODE` in `config.php`).
- No more "unlimited" volume/time products or trial accounts (Nexra can't
  represent unlimited, so the bot no longer offers it anywhere).
- Trial accounts and paid purchases can offer the customer a choice between
  a custom username or a random one via two buttons, instead of a fixed
  admin-picked method.
- Rebranded welcome/admin messages (no upstream branding).

## Install (one line)

```bash
N=7 TOKEN='123456:abc-token' DOMAIN='bot7.example.com' ADMIN='123456789' \
NEXRA_SECRET='your-secret-code' CERT_EMAIL='you@example.com' \
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MHBehzadian/nexra-mirzabot/main/install.sh)
```

Requires: DNS for `DOMAIN` already pointing at this server, nginx +
php8.1-fpm + mysql + certbot already installed, and `botmirzapanel4`-style
prior setup only if you're overlaying onto an older install — a fresh
install via this script needs none of that, it's self-contained.

`N` must be a bot number not already used on this server
(`/var/www/html/botmirzapanel<N>` must not exist yet).
